# Synthetic Underwater Object Detection
A proof-of-concept research project at Applied Physics Lab at University of Washington.
Can we detect an object underwater using a model that only knows how the object looks in a 3D model (CAD/Solidworkds)?

Data and evaluation directory can be requested by contacting us.

## Motivation
In certain scenarios, object detection systems are expected to work in real-world scenes with no or very-limited prior in-situ (real-world) exposure. We have a scenario where we expect underwater bots with greyscale camera to detect an object located underwaater in scenes to which we have no or very limited prior exposure. Studying the impact of in-situ data on the performance of such a system would help us plan out the data collection requirements to deploy the system in real-world environments.

## Problem Statement
We consider a test set from real-world scenarios consisting of images with labeled bounding boxes over the object of interest. We consider Average Precision at 0.5 IOU (Intersection Over Union) as primary evaluation metric. We compare the performance of various object detection models:
- Built with only Synethitc data (0 real-world data)
